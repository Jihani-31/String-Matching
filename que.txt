Formulate your birthday as a string of numbers as follows:

Take the two least significant digits (rightmost digits) of your birth Year (e.g. 1988 -->  88 )
Take the Month as two digits (e.g. April --> 04)
Take the day using two digits (e.g. 1 --> 01)
Now your birthday string is: 880401


Implement all the string matching algorithms you have learned to search for this string in PI. You can use any programming language you are familiar with.

Use this link(https://ia800905.us.archive.org/30/items/Pi_to_100000000_places/pi.txt) 
to download the first 100 million digits of PI as a text file.


Submit a .zip file containing all the source codes and the results.txt file. results.txt file should contain your birthday string, list of indexes where a match is found for each string matching algorithm.
